Hello, thank you for taking the time to review my Uber Clone project.

The Uber Clone was my first React Native project. The objective for this app was to demonstrate my ability for front-end app design and simulate the “Ride” feature in the Uber app. With many of the components in this app, I used Tailwind for the inline styling. If a component had many styling attributes, I used a separate style constant to avoid messy inline code. With the styling and advanced features in this clone, it looks and feels very similar to the actual Uber app.
